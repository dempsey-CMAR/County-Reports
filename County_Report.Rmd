# Introduction

The Centre for Marine Applied Research (CMAR) measures [essential ocean variables](https://www.goosocean.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&layout=edit&id=283&Itemid=441) throughout Nova Scotia’s coastal waters as part of the Coastal Monitoring Program. This program was initiated by the Nova Scotia Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture in 2012 and CMAR became involved in 2017. For more information on CMAR and the Coastal Monitoring Program, visit the [CMAR website](https://cmar.ca/). 

This document presents deployment details and summary figures of Water Quality data collected for **`r county` County** (Figure `r k` and Figure `r k+1`). The data are available for download from the Nova Scotia [Open Data Portal](https://data.novascotia.ca/browse?tags=coastal+monitoring+program) and from the ERDAPP server through the [Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing platform](https://catalogue.cioosatlantic.ca/dataset?q=cmar). 

This document should be considered as a guide only, as data collection and retrieval are ongoing. The information may be revised pending ongoing data collection and analyses.

## Data Collection 

CMAR collects temperature, dissolved oxygen, and intermittent salinity data using autonomous sensors deployed on “sensor strings”. A sensor string typically consists of a line anchored to the sea floor by an acoustic release and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with sensors attached at various depths below the surface (as measured at low tide; Figure 3). Alternatively, strings may be attached to surface moorings, including floating docks, buoys, and equipment. Sensor strings are typically deployed for several months, and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour. Sensors are retrieved for data offload by triggering the acoustic release when applicable, by directly removing from surface moorings, or occasionally by divers or dragging. Sensor strings may be re-deployed at the same location or moved to another area of interest depending on program objectives.

## Data Processing

Some data were excluded from the dataset due to quality control processes.

# `r county` County Coastal Data

Coastal data is presented by waterbody. For each waterbody, there is a table of deployment details followed by figures showing the data at each station. A red line is included in temperature figures to indicate the -0.7° C superchill threshold for salmonids (for figures where the temperature falls below this threshold). Note the different axis scales for each figure.
